Feature: simple nmap attack to check for open ports

  Background:
    Given the "ping" command line binary is installed
    And the following environment variables:
      | name     | environment_variable_name |
      | hostname | GAUNTLT_ATTACK_SUBJECT    |

  Scenario: Pings should be blocked
    When I launch a "generic" attack with:
      """
      ping -c 1 -t 1 <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should match:
    """
    100% packet loss
    """
